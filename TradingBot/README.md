IMPORTANT: HAVE A WEAPON WITH ATLEAST 2 VALUE.

The very first automated trading bot for MM2 created using LUAu.
IMPORTANT! This script is finished, but you could very well optimise it and create a trade algorithm. The bot just checks if someone has a weapon with a better value than any weapon in your inventory. You must have a weapon with atleast +2 value.

(dumbest bot oat, guarenteed no trade, it does work but people won't accept your trade bc your offer too high, feel free to implement your own algorithm for the trading bot, but please send it to me tho :>>)

The very first Murder Mystery 2 Trade Bot!
I chose to release this to the public because I don't wanna update huge list ðŸ’”.
 

1. For it to work, please download these two files:
-fullscript.lua
-hugelist.txt

2. Put hugelist.txt inside your workspace folder.


Also, if the game updates, hugetable.lua won't update itself and won't put into the table the new weapons inside the table. If you wish to trade the latest weapons, well update it yourself bro ðŸ˜­
Side note: I basically scrape off the value, etc.. from supreme value, but if supreme value changes layout, whole script breaks, not my fault I said I am NOT updating ts ðŸ’”
